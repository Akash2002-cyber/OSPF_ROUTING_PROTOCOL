First take the router, switch and PC's required to install the single lan.

{I have to take a  4 Computers, 1 (2960-24 TT) Switch , 5 (2811) Routers}

Then connect each computer to the switch

{ each computers and switch can be connected through COPPER STRAIGHT THROUGH cables.}  

Then connect the switch and the router.

And now to setup router's serial Ports.

{ # Go to the Router's Physical Modules.

  # Switch off the Router.

  # And pickup a HWIC-2T Module.

  # Drag the module and drop the port.
 
  # Switch on the Router.

Follow the step to each other Routers.


Now connected all types of devices and then choose the IP address for each computer and configure it.
{I will take a C class IP Address.}
{Each Computer IP Configuration
 
    #Go to Desktop
    #Click IP configuration
    #Enter IP address, Subnet mask, Default Gateway
    #And click close option }

The next step is to configure the router.

{Router Configuration Comments

   #enable
   #config terminal
   #interface fa 0/0
   #ip address (ip Address)(subnet mask)
   #no shutdown
   #exit 

   # interface se 0/0/0
   #ip address (ip Address)(subnet mask)
   #no shutdown
   #exit

   # interface se 0/0/1
   #ip address (ip Address)(subnet mask)
   #no shutdown
   #exit 

Follow the step to each other Routers.


Next we have to configure the OSPF

Go to CLI 

OSPF Configuration Comments 

{Router 1}
----------
  $ enable

  $ config terminal 

  $ route ospf 1

  $ network (network address) (wildcard mask) area 1

  $ network (network address) (wildcard mask) area 1

  $ exit
  
  $ exit

  $ write


(important****  network address is which network IP address can be used in the lan.)


{Router 2}
----------
  $ enable

  $ config terminal 

  $ route ospf 2

  $ network (network address) (wildcard mask) area 1

  $ network (network address) (wildcard mask) area 0

  $ exit
  
  $ exit

  $ write


(important****  network address is which network IP address can be used in the lan.)



{Router 3}
----------
  $ enable

  $ config terminal 

  $ route ospf 3

  $ network (network address) (wildcard mask) area 0

  $ exit

  $ write


(important****  network address is which network IP address can be used in the lan.)



{Router 4}
----------
  $ enable

  $ config terminal

  $ exit
  
  $ exit

  $ write


(important****  network address is which network IP address can be used in the lan.)



{Router 5}
----------
  $ enable

  $ config terminal 

  $ route ospf 5

  $ network (network address) (wildcard mask) area 2

  $ network (network address) (wildcard mask) area 2

  $ exit
  
  $ exit

  $ write


(important****  network address is which network IP address can be used in the lan.)
